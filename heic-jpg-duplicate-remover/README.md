# iPhone HEIC Jpg Duplicate Remover

iPhone cameras have a feature that can result in 2 formats of the same photo, HEIC and JPG.
HEIC is roughtly 50% of the size of JPG, and since I can view HEIC files on my PC, I have no need for the JPG.

This extremely simple Python script removes the duplicate JPG files. Just drop the script into the directory and run it.
